;;; Commentary:

;; Provides a simple way to toggle fullscreen of a single buffer, and go back to
;; the previous window configuration afterwards.

;;; Code:

(defvar fullscreen-alist
  nil
  "List of window-configurations stored before calling ´fullscreen´.")

;;;###autoload
(defun fullscreen ()
  "Make the current buffer fill the entire window."
  (interactive)
  (if (one-window-p)
      (message "Cannot fullscreen the only open window.")
    (message "entered fullscreen")
    (add-to-list 'fullscreen-alist (window-state-get))
    (delete-other-windows)))

;;;###autoload
(defun fullscreen-quit ()
  "Return to the previous window configuration."
  (interactive)
  (message "exited fullscreen")
  (window-state-put (pop fullscreen-alist)))

;;;###autoload
(defun fullscreen-toggle ()
  "Toggle fullscreen state of a single buffer."
  (interactive)
  (if fullscreen-alist
      (fullscreen-quit)
    (fullscreen)))

(provide 'fullscreen)
